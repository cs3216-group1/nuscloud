<h3 id="request">Request</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The headers must include a <strong>valid authentication token</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If made through the SDK, this is handled in the SDK itself and can therefore be ignored.</p>

<p>Special cases of this request substitute <strong>me</strong> for <strong>:userId</strong> to get info of the logged in user and/or <strong>app</strong> for <strong>:appid</strong> to get data for current logged in app.</p>

<p>If not made by the app itself, requires <strong>(app-namespace)-read</strong> permission, where (app-namespace) is the namespace of the app whose data would be read.</p>

<p>To get data of a user who is not logged in, the following conditions must be met:
* The target user must have signed into the app
* The target user must be a friend of the logged-in user
* Both the target user and the logged-in user must have enabled the <strong>friends-read</strong> permission</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<p>Sends back an object containing info stored at the path.</p>

<p>This endpoint supports nesting. In a case where a request to <em>/me/app/example</em> returns this:</p>

<p><code>{
    status: 'ok',
    data: {
        category: 'basket',
        apples: 3,
        type: 'fresh',
    }
}</code></p>

<p>Then a request to <em>/me/app/example/apples</em> would return this:</p>

<p><code>{
    status: 'ok',
    data: 3 
}</code></p>

<p>For errors responses, see the <a href="#/error-codes">status documentation</a>.</p>
