<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>NUSCloud aims to be a collaborative backend service for applications serving the NUS community, hosted <a href="nuscloud.jishnumohan.com">here</a>. To achieve this, it exposes an API to applications allowing them to authenticate users, to store data, and for users to share data across applications.</p>

<p>Through this, NUSCloud aims to minimize redundancy both in terms of developer code and user data entry - improving experience across the board and hopefully contributing to boost application development and growth targeted to NUS students. </p>

<h3 id="api-details">API Details</h3>

<p>NUSCloud exposes a REST-like API which can be accessed via HTTP requests. To simplify integration for client-side focussed applications, the use of the Javascript SDK is recommended.</p>

<p>With the exception of login and logout endpoints, all API paths below are relative to http://nuscloud.jishnumohan.com/api/ for HTTP requests. Details for the Javascript SDK are given in its dedicated section.</p>
