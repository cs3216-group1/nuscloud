<ul>
  <li>The headers must include a <strong>valid authentication token</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If made through the SDK, this is handled in the SDK itself and can therefore be ignored.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Request body sent cannot be empty</strong> and must include a <strong>data</strong> attribute containing the data to be put at the specified path. The data attribute is expected to be a Javascript Object. If the SDK is being used, the data attribute can contain any Javascript primitive data type (Number, String, Boolean)</li>
</ul>

<p>Special cases of this request substitute <strong>me</strong> for <strong>:userId</strong> to edit info of the logged in user and/or <strong>app</strong> for <strong>:appid</strong> to edit data for currently logged in app.</p>

<p>As of now, this request can only be made by the currently logged in app to edit data of the logged in user.</p>

<p>This endpoint supports nesting. A request to <em>/me/app/example</em> with this data:</p>

<p><code>{
    data: {
        apples: 3
    }
}</code></p>

<p>Is equivalent to this request to <em>/me/app/example/apples</em>:</p>

<p><code>{
    data: 3 
}</code></p>
