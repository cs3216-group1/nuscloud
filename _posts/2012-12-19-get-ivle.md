This method returns users data for the IVLE resource as specified by the path.

### Request

* The headers must include a **valid authentication token**.

If made through the SDK, this is handled in the SDK itself and can therefore be ignored.

This request requires user to have granted a **ivle-read** permission and have authenticated the app using IVLE. It also requires that the app have been registered on NUSCloud with a valid IVLE LAPI Key as this will allow NUSCloud to make requests on behalf of the app.

The path to be used is based on the UriTemplate of the resource as specified by the [LAPI reference](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/ivlelapi/LAPI+Reference) without the prefix *https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/api/Lapi.svc/*.

Further, arguments for the APIKey and Token / AuthToken are ignored as these are added by NUSCloud.

To illustrate with examples:

To get NUS ID of user, a GET request to:

```https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/api/Lapi.svc/UserID_Get?APIKey={System.String}
    &Token={System.String}```

can be made via:

```nuscloud.get('/ivle/UserID_Get', callback);```

To get modules taken by user, a GET request to:

```https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/api/Lapi.svc/Modules_Taken?APIKey={System.String}
    &AuthToken={System.String}&StudentID={System.String}```

can be made via:

```nuscloud.get('ivle/Modules_Taken?StudentID={String}', callback);```

### Response

Sends back an object containing the resource as specified by the path.

```{
    status: 'ok',
    ivleResponse: {response from IVLE}   
}```

For errors responses, see the [status documentation](#/error-codes).
