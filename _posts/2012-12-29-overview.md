### About

NUSCloud aims to be a collaborative backend service for applications serving the NUS community, hosted [here](nuscloud.jishnumohan.com). To achieve this, it exposes an API to applications allowing them to authenticate users, to store data, and for users to share data across applications.

Through this, NUSCloud aims to minimize redundancy both in terms of developer code and user data entry - improving experience across the board and hopefully contributing to boost application development and growth targeted to NUS students. 

### API Details

NUSCloud exposes a REST-like API which can be accessed via HTTP requests. To simplify integration for client-side focussed applications, the use of the Javascript SDK is recommended.

With the exception of login and logout endpoints, all API paths below are relative to http://nuscloud.jishnumohan.com/api/ for HTTP requests. Details for the Javascript SDK are given in its dedicated section.
