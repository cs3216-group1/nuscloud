This method edits the IVLE resource of the user as specified by the path.

### Request

* The headers must include a **valid authentication token**.

If made through the SDK, this is handled in the SDK itself and can therefore be ignored.

This request requires user to have granted a **ivle-write** permission and have authenticated the app using IVLE. It also requires that the app have been registered on NUSCloud with a valid IVLE LAPI Key as this will allow NUSCloud to make requests on behalf of the app.

The path to be used is based on the UriTemplate of the resource as specified by the [LAPI reference](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/ivlelapi/LAPI+Reference) without the prefix *https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/api/Lapi.svc/*.

Further, arguments for the APIKey and Token / AuthToken are ignored as these are added by NUSCloud.

To illustrate with examples:

To post a new forum thread (JSON), a POST request to:

```https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/api/Lapi.svc/Forum_PostNewThread_JSON```

with the data:

```{
    APIKey: {APIKey},
    AuthToken: {AuthToken},
    HeadingID: {Heading to which thread is posted},
    Title: {Title of thread},
    Reply: {Message body}
}```

can be made via:

```nuscloud.post('/ivle/Forum_PostNewThread_JSON', callback);```

with the data:

```{
    HeadingID: {Heading to which thread is posted},
    Title: {Title of thread},
    Reply: {Message body}
}```

### Response

Sends back an object containing the response from IVLE.

```{
    status: 'ok',
    ivleResponse: {response from IVLE}   
}```

For errors responses, see the [status documentation](#/error-codes).
